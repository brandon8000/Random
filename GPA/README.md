# GPA Calculator
The first assignment I ever helped someone with after I became a coder. After giving that person some tips, I copied the assignment description and coded my own version.
Type in up to 5 grades and it calculates a grade-point average based on the standard 4.0 scale.
Requires the provided IO.class file for reading user input.
