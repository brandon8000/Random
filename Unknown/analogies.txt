Analogies for Days!
==============
Take an input English sentence and tokenize it.
Replace the tokens with new words from a dictionary of words that
includes their parts of speech
Example:
	Given:	A monkey stole my banana!
	Output:	A football contemplated my staircase!
Consider using word similarity between various tokens to choose new
words that produce a similar conceptual relationship as the original input.
Example:
	Given:	The sky is blue.
	Output:	The grass is green
