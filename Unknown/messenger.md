# Don't Shoot the Messenger!
Just replace him with a friendlier one.

## Basic Goal
Use Facebook's [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/examples#graphapi) to read your [Messenger inbox](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.10/user/inbox) on a static github page.

## Stretch Goal
Hack around with [this CLI program](https://github.com/AstroCB/Messenger-CLI) and create a web version after you learn how to [run node projects on github](http://kennethormandy.com/journal/start-a-blog-with-harp/) (or just use heroku).
