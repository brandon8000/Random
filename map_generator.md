# Map Generator

I love what you did with [Abstractify](https://github.com/brandon8000/abstractify)! Can you use this to generate maps?

 - First, use advanced python libraries [like this](https://github.com/mattnedrich/MeanShift_py/issues/5) to generate a random distribution of data.

 - Then turn that data into an image that is processed by Abstractify.

 - Then let people cut that image into a tileset using a [small application](https://github.com/jcsnider/Multi-Purpose-Graphic-Splitter) or a [GIMP plugin](https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/resynth-tiles)
