# Python Methodologies for Data Science
Fall 2017 - Rutgers University
## Background
An intro programming course I took as part of my Masters program. It covers the absolute basics of programming all the way up to scientific computing and data visualiztion.
 Watch the lectures on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/biglrz/videos).
## What's in Here
The homework assignments, quizzes and the final project. I broke it up by Unit, where applicable. All commits are pushed online once the Unit has been completed, to avoid getting copied.

Note that all code is written in Python 3.x
