# Copy Stuff via Java Byte Stream
After my Intro to Computer Science class, I decided to learn more about how to code in Java. The first topic I looked into was the Java Byte Stream.
This is a program that accepts a text file and copies the text into an output file, "outputText.txt"
The user can specify whether the copying should be done byte by byte or character by character. THe difference isn't visible but I certainly enjoyed playing around with these different methods!
